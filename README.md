# BikeshareSytemAnalysis
In this project, an exploratory analysis was performed on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. The system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC will be analysed. We also saw if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.
